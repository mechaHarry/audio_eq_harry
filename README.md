For Windows users, install Equalizer APO and add an 'include' filter that selects any textfile in this repo.
For all other platforms, if there exists a parametric eq either system wide or application wide, these values can be placed in as Freq, Deci, and Q Values manually.

These settings per headphone were made using my ears perception of multiple slow sweeps through the sound spectrum, honing in on tinnitus inducing frequencies or harsh/coarse/offensive/unbalanced frequencies made by the particular headphones.

The settings are then test run through a wide variety of musics with different masterings to help fine-tune the Deci and Q Values of any specific frequencies, as well as optionally placed high or low pass filters to adjust for bass fullness or treble air, to taste.

The final pass through is to play music and videos as usual, while toggling singular frequencies to judge if any particular filters are necessary or not.

The EQ Setting for the headphone is then complete at this stage, unless there are micro adjustments discovered or to be made in the future.

These EQ are made either as a result of lack of measurements or EQ online from sources such as oratory1990 or AutoEQ, or when either source's EQ are unsatisfactory for any reason. Both of these sources are highly respectable, valuable, and powerful as they have given me larger insight into how EQ can play a part in improving the performance of headphones.

If our hearing preferences are similar, there should be a commonly felt reduction in stress, increased perception of sounds found deeper in the mix often hidden behind coarse or unbalanced frequencies, as well as an increased roomspace illusion when seeing-with-the-ears, revealing true depth in the sound rather than a wall of sound.

The objective is to remove offensive areas of the headphone's capabilities while preserving or leaving untouched the areas that have no fault. In this way, the EQ are considered a signal attenuator or enhancement, rather than a complete change in signature or taste.

Disclaimer: The settings are adjusted to fit how my ears, ear canals, and HRTF perceive and are affected by the headphones; this can be different from person to person, especially tinnitus inducing frequencies or sensitive frequencies.
