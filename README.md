### Usage:

For Windows users, install Equalizer APO and add an 'include' filter that selects any eq in this repo.
For all other platforms, if there exists a parametric eq either system wide or application wide, these values can be placed in as Freq, Deci, and Q Values manually.

### Methodology:

These eq per headphone are made by first slowly sweeping through the sound spectrum, honing in on tinnitus inducing frequencies or harsh frequencies made by the particular headphones.
The objective is to remove any offensive areas found within the headphone's frequency response.

### Disclaimer:

The settings are adjusted to fit how my ears, ear canals, and HRTF perceive and are affected by the headphones; this can be different from person to person, especially tinnitus inducing frequencies or sensitive frequencies.
